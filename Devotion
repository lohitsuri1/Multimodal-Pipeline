To add Radha Krishna visuals and devotional music for YouTube, you’ll need two things: copyright‑safe images/videos and copyright‑safe audio, then combine them in a video editor and upload. [support.google](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/94316?hl=en)

## 1. Where to get Radha Krishna visuals (safe to use)

Use sources that clearly say “royalty free / no copyright / free stock footage” and check their license:

- Free Radha Krishna video backgrounds: Some YouTube channels upload “Radha Krishna Devotional Background | No copyright | Free Stock videos” that can be reused in your projects; always read description and follow their credit rules.  [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0YExUrzlRk)  
- Stock footage sites: Platforms like Shutterstock have Radha Krishna clips; these are paid, but once licensed you can use them in your video. [shutterstock](https://www.shutterstock.com/video/search/radha-krishna)
- Your own visuals: Photos or small video clips you shoot in temples, home mandir, diyas, flowers, sunrise, etc. are safest because you fully own them.

Avoid:
- Taking random images/videos from Google or other YouTube videos without clear license → high risk of copyright claim.

## 2. Where to get devotional background music (no copyright issues)

Look for “royalty‑free / no copyright / free for YouTube” bhakti or Indian instrumental tracks and always read licensing terms:

- YouTube Audio Library: Free music meant for YouTube, many Indian / devotional style tracks; you can add them from inside YouTube Studio or download and use in an editor. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hg7rLXxjIQ)
- Devotional royalty‑free tracks:  
  - Collections of “Devotional Music – Royalty Free / No Copyright” that you can use with proper credit in description. [chosic](https://www.chosic.com/free-music/devotional/)
  - Some Indian devotional music providers sell lifetime royalty‑free licenses (pay once, use in unlimited videos); they require you to mention credits in description. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tM0CoJsD7Qk)
- Your own recording: Tanpura, flute, or soft manjira recorded by you or a friend is 100% safe.

Always:
- Check if “credit required” and paste exact credit line in your description. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lc7J3nVMdx0)

## 3. How to combine visuals + music (simple workflow)

You can use any editor: Clipchamp, Canva, CapCut, VN, Kinemaster, Filmora, etc. The basic steps are the same. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x30Gt4L1dgM)

1. Import visuals  
   - Open your video editor and create a new 30‑minute project.  
   - Add your Radha Krishna clips/photos to the timeline and arrange them in the order you like (slow zooms, gentle cross‑fade transitions feel devotional). [media](https://www.media.io/video-editors-tips/add-background-music-in-youtube.html)

2. Add your voice recording  
   - Record your 30‑minute satsang / meditation audio separately on phone or mic.  
   - Import this audio file and place it on the main audio track in sync with the visuals. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x30Gt4L1dgM)

3. Add background music under the voice  
   - Import your chosen devotional track (or select from built‑in music library if your editor has one). [canva](https://www.canva.com/features/add-music-to-video/)
   - Put it on a second audio track below your voice, lower the volume (usually 10–25% so your voice is always clear). [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEpzn8Gb_9E)
   - If music is shorter than 30 minutes, loop it by copying and placing the track back‑to‑back.

4. Export the final video  
   - Export in 1080p (Full HD), MP4 format.  
   - Check once that there is no sudden loud music or blank black screen.

## 4. Adding or changing music directly in YouTube Studio (optional)

If your video is already uploaded without music, you can still add music from YouTube’s own library. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgQ-d1ATalU)

- Go to YouTube Studio → Content → select video → Editor.  
- In the Editor, under the audio section, click “Add a track” and choose from YouTube’s free music library. [support.google](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/94316?hl=en)
- Adjust start point and volume, then save changes; YouTube will process the edit. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hg7rLXxjIQ)

## 5. Description, title, and credits (important for bhakti videos)

- Title example: “30 Minute Radha Krishna Morning Meditation | Bhagavad Gita Reflections | Relaxing Flute Music”  
- In description, include:
  - Short line about the purpose of the video (morning devotional listening, not a replacement for scripture study).  
  - Exact credits for music/footage as demanded by the license. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tM0CoJsD7Qk)
- Add tags like: “Radha Krishna”, “Bhagavad Gita”, “morning meditation”, “bhakti”, “Hindu devotional music”.

If you tell me which editor/app you plan to use (mobile or laptop and app name), I can give step‑by‑step instructions specifically for that tool.
